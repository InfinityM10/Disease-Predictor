        "description": "An odontogenic keratocyst (OKC) is a rare, benign but locally aggressive cystic lesion that originates from dental lamina remnants. It is characterized by its thin, fragile wall and high recurrence rate. This type of cyst typically develops in the jaw bone and can grow slowly over time. The cyst is lined with keratinized epithelium and has a tendency to recur after surgical removal.",
        "key_features": [
            "Most commonly found in the lower jaw (mandible)",
            "Typically affects individuals between 20-40 years old",
            "Can be associated with genetic conditions like Gorlin syndrome"
        ],
        "clinical_significance": "Requires careful surgical management due to high recurrence risk and potential for local invasion. Regular follow-up and monitoring are crucial to prevent repeated development."
    },
    "Dentigerous Cyst": {
        "description": "A dentigerous cyst is a developmental odontogenic cyst that surrounds the crown of an unerupted tooth. It forms when fluid accumulates between the reduced enamel epithelium and the crown of an unerupted tooth. These cysts are typically associated with impacted or unerupted teeth and can cause displacement of adjacent teeth if left untreated.",

            "Most common type of developmental odontogenic cyst",
            "Usually affects impacted or unerupted teeth",

        ],
        "clinical_significance": "Generally benign and can be treated by surgical removal of the cyst and associated tooth. Early detection prevents potential complications like tooth displacement or bone resorption."
    },
    "Dental Follicle": {
        "description": "A dental follicle is a soft tissue surrounding the developing tooth crown before tooth eruption. It plays a crucial role in tooth development and contains the cells that will form important dental structures. The follicle is a transitional tissue that is essential for the normal formation and eruption of teeth, and can sometimes develop into pathological conditions if abnormal changes occur.",
        "key_features": [
            "Contains cells that will form periodontal ligament, cementum, and alveolar bone",
            "Critical in the process of tooth formation and eruption",
            "Can develop into various pathological conditions if abnormal"
        ],

    ### How to Use the Histopathology Analysis System
    
    1. **Upload Image**: Use the file uploader to select a TIFF image.
    2. **Image Processing**: The system generates a thumbnail and analyzes tissue.
    3. **Results Interpretation**: Displays predicted disease type and confidence.
    
    ### Supported Tissue Types
    - Odontogenic Keratocyst
    - Dentigerous Cyst
    - Dental Follicle
